time has the diverse relation with space
to calcutate the time spend in algorithm we use %timeit sth

to find the addres in array the formula is a[0]+(the place we want to find its addres * 8
8 is the space which is byte in arrays
access in array big o notation is (o)1
search o(n)
delet o(n)
insert o(n)
on = linear search

lined list
access o(n)
search  o(n)
delet  1(n)
insert 1(n)





import sys

sys.getsizeof([]) = 56
sysgetsizeof([1]) = 64
64-56= 8 bit   sysgetsizeof([1])-56


#best case in list
x=[1,2,3]
x.append(4)
print (x)

#worse case in list
