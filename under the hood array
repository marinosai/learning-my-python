from array import array
a=array('i',[1,2,3])
print(a[0])

#the time (accessing) in which it spends to find a[0] is the same as to find a[1] 
for example

from array import array
a=array('i',[1,2,3])
%timeit a[0]

from array import array
a=array('i',[1,2,3])
%timeit a[1]

in the array to find the addres it calculate in this way: a[0]+n*8 bite 
for example i want to find the 7th table it calculate a[0]+7*8

time has the diverse relation with space
to calcutate the time spend in algorithm we use %timeit sth

to find the addres in array the formula is a[0]+(the place we want to find its addres * 8
8 is the space which is byte in arrays

access in array big o notation is (o)1
search o(n)
delet o(n)
insert o(n)
on = linear search

lined list
access o(n)
search  o(n)
delet  1(n)
insert 1(n)

list in python
access : a[0]+n*8  big o notation= o(1)
search : o(n)
delet: o(n)
insert o(n)
it is the same as array but the difference is that in this case the spaces are homogenous



import sys

sys.getsizeof([]) = 56
sysgetsizeof([1]) = 64
64-56= 8 bit   sysgetsizeof([1])-56


#best case in list
x=[1,2,3]
x.append(4)
print (x)

#worse case in list

sys.getsizeof(sth())
sys.getsizeof(a([0])


list in pythone
access = o(1)
%timeit a[1]
a=list(range(999))

a=[1,2,3]
[1]+a    #worst case because it should shift all the numbers incliding (1,2,3)
#but 
a=[1,2,3]
a.append(5)  # this is best case
