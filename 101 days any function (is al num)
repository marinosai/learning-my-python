The error you're encountering is likely because you're trying to use the isnumeric() method on an integer (y is an integer from list a). The isnumeric() method is a string method and cannot be directly used on non-string types like integers.

If you want to check if all elements in the list are numeric, you should convert them to strings before applying the isnumeric() method. Here's the corrected code:

python
Copy code
a = [1, 3, 4]
b = ['s', 'd']

result = any(str(y).isnumeric() for y in a)
print(result)
This code will convert each element in list a to a string before checking if it's numeric. If any element is numeric, the any() function will return True. If none of the elements are numeric, it will return False.


typp={1,'s'}
a=[str(u) for u in typp]
print(a)
